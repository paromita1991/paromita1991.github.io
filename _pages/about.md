Welcome!

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Data Sciences and Operations](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/departments/data-sciences-and-operations) at [USC Marshall Business School](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/). My research centers around developing statistical methods for nonEuclidean data, examples being distribution and network valued data and time varying object data. Here are links to my CV, Google Scholar and Math Genealogy. 

Previously, I was a Stein Fellow/Lecturer in the Department of Statistics at Stanford University. Prior to Stanford, I was a postdoc working with Prof. Hans-Georg MÃ¼ller, who is also my PhD advisor, and Prof. Jane-Ling Wang in the Department of Statistics at University of California, Davis.

I finished my PhD in June 2019. Before that I obtained a Bachelor of Statistics in 2012 and a Master of Statistics in 2014 from the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata.

If you are interested in my research, feel free to send me an email.

I love to sketch. In my spare time I sometimes go on sketchcrawls. I enjoy being outdoors, and given any opportunity I like to find myself on a ridge or a peak or a pass or a lake.
