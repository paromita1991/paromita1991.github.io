Modeling and inference for dynamic networks- generating mechanisms and reconstruction of network archeology.


Interface of statistics and metric geometry - broadly applicable statistical methods, theory and inference for analyzing metric space valued data with applications in brain imaging studies, child neurological development, traffic network analysis, social network analysis, genetics and compositional data.

Functional and longitudinal data analysis and its overlap with metric geometry- with focus on studying samples of dynamic metric space data, examples being time varying networks, distributions or tree valued data.



Online learning problems- specifically contextual multi-armed bandit problems with unconventional contexts.
